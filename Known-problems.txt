"PIL.UnidentifiedImageError" on "img = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(link_image).content))". Not sure if it's requests.get().content or BytesIO() fucking up, or if it's related to connection ((lack of) cert or something) since manually going to the link on firefox then reselecting the country in the same session also fixes the problem
